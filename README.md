# TOP UNIVERSITY RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM FOR SECONDARY SCHOOL STUDENTS

This is a C++ program designed to help parents of secondary school students better understand the quality of universities around the world and plan a better future education for their children. The program uses the 2023 QS university ranking dataset, which contains information of more than 1400 different universities from all over the world, to provide recommendations to the users.


## Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)


## Overview
- Double Linked List
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Linear Search
- Jump Search
- Linear Transition Search (proposed)

### Sort Algorithms
1. Merge sort algorithms had been fully utilised as a finaly sort algorithms in this system.
2. Comparision exec time between merge sort and bubble sort.
3. Sort result based on specific attributes in doubly linked list.

### Search Algorithms
1. Linear Transition + Linear search had been fully utilised as a finaly search algorithms in this system. 
2. Comparision exec time between jump / linear / linear transition search.
3. [Result] -> Linear transition search time will decrease while keep searching on same items but if search different items the exec time will same like the linear search.
